# MyFriend React app

This app is to demonstrate my ability to use Promises in a single page React app.
After the page is rendered, I fetch a JSON list of users from [https://gorest.co.in/](https://gorest.co.in/).
Then I map each user and extend with a URL of a random AI generated face image from [https://github.com/ozgrozer/100k-faces](https://github.com/ozgrozer/100k-faces).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Deployment

You can deploy the app by running 'npm start deploy'
